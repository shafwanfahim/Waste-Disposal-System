# Waste-Disposal-System 

An automated waste sorting/disposal system set up in the Quanser Interactive Labs environment. The following code was also tested in a physical environment and completed tasks such as using a Q-arm (robotic arm) to load garbage products, use sensors to classify the type of garbage, and then using a Q-bot (programmed robot) with an actuator to dispense the waste in the appropriate location.  

Please check the main function for the full source code.
